Make the framework compatible with resnet structure 
    To achieve multi-scale output (using different blocks & resolution?)    - done
    Add some post layers?                                                   - done 

Dataloader:
    Multiple scales (This can be done in loss class)                        - done 
    One output heatmap                                                      - done 

Loss:
    Forward the model with different resolutions, and stack different heatmaps together                     - done
    Compute the heatmap loss (dont know whether it is supported by the distributed training)                - done 

------ Debug the above modules and train on COCO to see the outcome 
------ We can train a network using the above modules and test the overall recall & OKS curve using the closest joints approach (upper bound) ------

Sampling:
    Different sampling policy for different scale 
    Online infer the labels 

GCN:
    Attention mechanism 
    May need to add position encoding 

GCN Loss:
    Confidence (whether GT is included in the patch)
    Bias (offset of the joint. What kind of normalization is needed? Or just compute the original pixel shift?)
    Feature (triplet or circle loss can be used here.)
